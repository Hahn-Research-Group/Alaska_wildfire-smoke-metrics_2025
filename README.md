# Metrics for assessing the population health impact of wildfire smoke in Alaska
### Created by: Melissa Bradley

## Background

This repository provides R and Python code that was used for analysis of a longitudinal wildfire smoke dataset created for the state of Alaska for May-September of 2003 to 2020 in order to assess seasonal and long-term population exposure to wildfire smoke and identify geospatial subdivisions and demographic groups that are most vulnerable to the population health impacts of wildfire smoke events. The findings of these analyses are available here: (Update link after publication).

## Methods

This was an ecological study evaluating population health impacts of wildfire smoke in Alaska. Wildfire-specific fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure estimates were aggregated to the census tract level for 2003-2020. Census tract information was obtained from the Alaska Department of Labor and Statistics. Next, we calculated person-days of exposure to medium and heavy smoke, the frequency and duration of smoke waves, and census tract-level wildfire smoke-specific social vulnerability rankings.
